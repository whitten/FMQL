The schema companion of DescribeReply: a utility to cross the protocol-model boundary. This turns a DESCRIBE TYPE reply into FileInfos, FileMan schema definitions.

NOTE: after FMQL V2, this will merge with CONTEXT GENERATION UTILITIES. In effect, 
context captures the FileInfo nuance exposed here and overlaps with some of its functions.
"context" == "mini schema format".

    A simple facade for easy access to an FMQL Describe Type result, a peer of FMQLDescribeResult. To FMQL's exposure of FileMan's Native Schema, it highlights:
    - list multiple: multiples with only one field - these 'sub files' represent simple lists of items
    - does a field "own" its name ie/ is it the first user of a name. Remember that 
    - set of codes: some are just booleans (Y or Y/N). These are distinguished from "proper" sets of codes.
    
    Fixes FMQL quirks:
    - file id returned in . form in Schema but Data uses _ form. _ form used here
    - lot's of "detail" stuffed into one 'detail' field. Expanded in FieldInfo

    TODO: 
    - the easy access provided here will inform improvements to the raw FMQL JSON scheduled for V1.1.
    - handle "corrupt" file and "corrupt" field info properly for easy reports
    - dinum etc and a lot more nuance in fields including ranges [for fuller schema defn]
